# Mathflix

This is Mathflix, an app used by researchers from the MUN psychology department for their research experiment. 

## Structure of the app:

The UI for the app is split into 3 parts for 3 users:

* **1. Researcher:** for those who are part of the research team, they access the analytics behind the user interactions.
* **2. Parent:** for the parents to interact with parts of the app that involve setting sessions and blocking apps for their children.
* **3. Child:** for the children that will be part of the research. They will be directly interacting with the app functions mainly associated with answering quizzes that have certain constraints.
